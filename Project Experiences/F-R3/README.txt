The document called “SRS R3, Group F” includes
the system requirements for the CRASH system our customer LADA wants us to develop. 

The document called “Project Experiences R3, Group F” includes information such as how we worked as a team to elicit the requirements, why we chose to work in a specific way etc. It also includes individual reflections from each team member about their own work process and contributions for this release (R3) as well as some reflections from the previous releases. 

We have included the context diagram separately as well for better visualization purposes.

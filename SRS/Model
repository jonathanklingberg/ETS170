When the authentication is done, Niklas and his friends enter the car and Niklas tells the car where to drive using voice control, when this is done, the car drives the passengers to the given addresses. One of Niklas’ friends lives further away than Niklas himself and he is tired and he wants to be dropped off first. Since Niklas was the official “Driver” and now leaves the car, the passenger left in the car has to authenticate himself and thus becomes a authenticated passenger, using the fingerprint scanner.

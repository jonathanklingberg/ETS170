\section{Introduction}
The car manufacturer LADA are worried about losing market shares and through their new product, a selfdriving car, they hope to maintain their position on the global car market. LADA themselves do not feel that they can produce a requirement specification to the quality standard they know is needed, which is why they have hired our company, Steve's Angels, to produce the requirements specification for the autonomous system called CRASH. 

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\noindent Inner stakeholders:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{End user} - All users that interact with the system such as the car owner and passengers. The end users have demands on the system to be safe and easy to use.
\item \textbf{LADA} - Car manufacturer and key customer of the requirement specification. LADA has a considerable amount of demands which the system must fulfill in order to meet their business goals. CRASH also integrates with their existing modules such as the control system and sensors.
\item \textbf{Steve's Angels} - Develops the software requirement specification. They have demands such that the system solution described in the requirement specification is formed in a sustainable way. They might want to sell their solution to other companies since LADA is only the key customer and Steve's Angels owns the rights of the SRS.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Outer stakeholders:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trafikverket} - Responsible for the long-term planning of infrastructure in Sweden. Can probably save money if the roads are used more efficiently. 
\item \textbf{Polismyndigheten} - The police is responsible for enforcing traffic regulations, and thus influenced by this product. With autonomous cars there will probably be less traffic offences, and thus they do not need to allocate as much resources in this area. 
\item \textbf{Swedish parliament} - The Parliament decides on all laws in Sweden, and a change in the law would be needed to allow driverless technology.
\item \textbf{Swedish government} - The government enforces the laws that Parliament decides on, see above.
\item \textbf{Trafikanalys} - Provides policy makers with a basis for making decisions about transport policy.
\item \textbf{Transportstyrelsen} - Secure and environmental friendly transports.
\item \textbf{Insurance companies} - Cars without drivers, or with only passengers (the driver is seen as a passenger when the car is running automatically) poses new problems concerning insurance and liability in traffic.
\item \textbf{Lantmäteriet} - Develops maps of Sweden, which is needed for the positining system to work.
\item \textbf{Sveriges Trafikskolors Riksförbund} - The Swedish organization for driving schools.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Main goals}
The goal is to deliver an autonomous vehicle system to the car manufacturer LADA for use in Sweden. As the car manufacturing industry develops, it is of great importance to keep up with the latest progress in terms of technology. Introducing new technology to the market is one way to maintain or expand market shares. The system we develop is LADA's answer to the current market situation.

The system must provide maximum traffic safety using the very latest achievements in the fields of navigation and anti-collision technology. This together with high passenger comfortability and excellent fuel economy will place LADA ahead of its competition.

\end{figure}

\noindent
\textbf{Passenger} There are two types of passengers, a passive passenger or an authenticated passenger. Both can press the emergency stop button, but only the authenticated passenger can ride in the car alone.\\
\textbf{Driver} Can do anything that a passenger can.
The driver can also drive the car manually, handle the voice control as well as choosing the destination. \\
\textbf{Owner} Can do anything that a driver can. The owner also handles user management. Which users are allowed to be drivers and passengers. \\
\textbf{Administrator} Can do anything that an owner can.
The administrator can change the system settings as well as general admin management \\
\textbf{Control system} - A system that interprets data from the surroundings sensory systems, and identifies appropriate navigation paths, obstacles, traffic lights and signage. \\
\textbf{Weather forecast system} - A system that can provide weather forecasts that the car can download and use to warn about dangerous weather conditions along the current route.  \\
\textbf{Position data system} - A system where the car can upload its current position. Used by the owner to locate the cars position and follow it along its path.  \\
\textbf{Traffic information system} - A system that keeps track of the current traffic situation (e.g. accidents, queues etc). \\
\textbf{Surroundings sensory system} - A system that consists of several different sensors that senses the cars surroundings.  \\

\subsection{Terminology}
\textbf{The system} - The delivered product. When nothing else is stated, requirements are specified for autonomous driving mode.\\
\textbf{Autonomous car} - An autonomous car is also known as a self driving car i.e. a car that operates without a driver. \\
\textbf{Ecodriving} - Ecodriving is a term used to describe energy efficient use of vehicles. It is a method for reducing fuel consumption when driving, so that less fuel is used to travel the same distance.\\
\textbf{Safe state} - The safe state is the cars state when it fulfills Swedish car inspection regulations.
REFERENCE: http://www.bilprovningen.se/Privat/Kontrollbesiktning/Vad-vi-kontrollerar.html\\
\textbf{GPS} - Global Positioning System based on space satellite communication.\\
\\
The requirements are named in the following manner:
\begin{description*}
\item[GoXX] - Goal requirements 
\item[DoXX] - Domain requirements 
\item[FPrXX] - Functional Product requirements 
\item[DPrXX] - Data Product requirements 
\item[DeXX] - Design requirements 
\item[QuXX] - Quality requirements 
\end{description*}

\section{Scenarios}
The following scenarios should be used to improve developer intuition. These scenarios are prioritized.
%Scenarios are used to improve developer intuition. The described scenarios are so called vivid scenarios, they consist of a case story illustrating one or more user tasks. It is important to note that vivid scenarios are not suitable as test cases.
\subsection {Remote pickup scenario}
Niklas is an owner of a CRASH-supported car and his football practice is over. He now remotely tells his car to pick him and his friends up at the football pitch, using his phone. The next step is that the car drives to pick up Niklas and his friends. When the car arrives, Niklas and his friends enter the car. Niklas tells the car which addresses to drive to, when this is done, the car drives the passengers to the given addresses. One of Niklas's friends lives further away than Niklas himself but since Niklas is tired he wants to be dropped off first. Niklas leaves the car at his home, then the car drives to the friend's house. After dropping of the friend, the car drives back to Niklas's home and parks.

\subsection {Predetermined route scenario}
Jonathan is an Owner of a CRASH-supported car and he got stuck in a meeting at work, which means that he cannot pick up his daughter at school as planned. Instead he uses his phone to remotely tell his car to pick up his child. The child receives a notification on her phone from the car that it is on its way for a pick up and how long it should take to arrive. When the car arrives, Jonathan’s daughter enters the car and tells it to drive to the candy store. The car tells her no since the route is predetermined by her father. Therefore, the car drives the child home instead.

\subsection {Buying new car scenario}
David is at his local LADA dealership to purchase a new LADA with the built-in CRASH system. At the dealership David’s is associated with the new car. Since David wants his son Alexander to be able to drive he assigns driver permissions to him as well.

\subsection {Running out of gas scenario}
Gordon is on his way to Stockholm to celebrate Christmas with his family. On the way, the system alerts him that it is running out of gas, thus the car stops at the nearest gas station and refuels itself.

\section{Tasks}
Each of the following tasks must be supported and are suitable as test cases.
